# WhereAreMyToilets

### Installation 
Nothing to do just download the project and you are good to go.

### No Libraries
Why I don't use libraries:
 - Easy installation
 - For a technical test I can show what I know
 - Alomafire may have been a bit overkill for the usage here
 - I manage my code base so I won't have a side effect from another lib

### No Combine
In the consigne we are ask to keep it simple. I know reactive programming is not the easiest thing to understand so I avoid it. I don't have a lot of good usage to in this test.

### Architecture
I choose MVVMC from a personnal preference. It's the one I use the most. It's a popular architecture so a lot of people know it to. I use Coordinator to have a better single responsability in my codebase.

### View programmatic
I choose to do everything programmaticaly cause I am use to it and my mac is a bit old so opening xib may have been a bit painfull. I don't use storyboard cause it's worse for my mac and for the collaboration I think it's not a great tool. I understand that programmaticly it's not the best to understand what a view do but it was easier for me this time.

### What I whould improve with more time

A lot of thing ! 
First of all I would have add coordinator for list and map to have a better spliting in my navigation.
I would have work a lot more on the UI/UX it's horrible and I am really sorry for that same for error management. 
I would have improve the offline mode with a better management of the data.
I would have add some UITest even if it's not the most interessting thing in this case.
I would have work more on the map adding the possibility if the user have his localisation on to draw road between him and the toilet he tap.
I would have add some information for the toilet like an image if I find one thanks the coordinate
